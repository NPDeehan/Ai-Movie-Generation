# Movie Generation Process

## Process Overview

This BPMN process outlines the steps for generating a movie idea and developing it into a more complete concept. The process involves several stages, including initial idea generation, plot creation, quote generation, and iterative refinement.

## Process Details

1. **Start Event**: The process begins with "Making a Movie" event.

2. **Get Initial Details**: A user task where initial movie details are gathered.

3. **Create Prompt**: A script task that formulates a prompt for the AI based on the initial movie idea.

4. **Decide on What to do**: An AI-powered service task that determines the next steps to take in developing the movie idea.

5. **Get elements**: A script task that processes the AI's suggestions into actionable tasks.

6. **Ad-hoc Subprocess**: This subprocess contains several potential tasks that can be executed based on the AI's suggestions:
   - Generate Plot Summary
   - Get Quote For Movie
   - Get Image for movie (manual task)
   - Decide on Casting (manual task)

7. **Create Movie Details**: A script task that compiles the generated information into a structured format.

8. **Check Idea**: An AI-powered service task that evaluates the current state of the movie idea and suggests improvements.

9. **Is Idea Complete?**: A gateway that determines whether the movie idea is sufficiently developed or needs further iteration.

10. **Show Idea**: If the idea is complete, this user task presents the final movie concept.

11. **End Event**: The process concludes with the "Movie is Decided" event.

## Implementation Details

- The process uses Camunda Cloud for execution.
- Several AI-powered tasks utilize OpenAI's GPT model through HTTP connectors.
- Script tasks are used for data manipulation and flow control.
- User tasks are employed for human input and review.
- An ad-hoc subprocess allows for flexible execution of tasks based on AI suggestions.
- The process includes a loop mechanism for iterative refinement of the movie idea.

## Key Technical Components

- Zeebe task definitions and I/O mappings for integrating with external services.
- Expression language usage for dynamic data handling and decision-making.
- Form definitions for user tasks to gather and present information.
- Error handling and retry mechanisms for robust execution.

This process demonstrates a creative application of BPMN and AI integration for movie concept development, showcasing how business process automation can be applied to creative industries.
